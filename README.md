# graphql-apollo-server

Implement a **GraphQL server with TypeScript** based on Prisma, [apollo-server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) and [GraphQL Nexus](https://graphql-nexus.com/).

## Getting Started

### 1. Download example & install dependencies

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flavioespinoza/graphql-apollo-server.git
```

Install Node dependencies:

```bash
cd graphql-apollo-server
npm i
```

### 2. Prisma CLI

Install Prisma CLI to run the server

```bash
npm i -g prisma
```

### 4. Docker Compose

1. Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. If not, you can get it from [here](https://store.docker.com/search?offering=community&type=edition).
1. Create `docker-compose.yml` for MySQL (see [here](https://www.prisma.io/docs/prisma-server/database-connector-POSTGRES-jgfr/) for Postgres):
    ```yml
    version: '3'
    services:
      prisma:
        image: prismagraphql/prisma:1.34
        restart: always
        ports:
        - "4466:4466"
        environment:
          PRISMA_CONFIG: |
            port: 4466
            databases:
              default:
                connector: mysql
                host: mysql
                port: 3306
                user: root
                password: prisma
                migrations: true
      mysql:
        image: mysql:5.7
        restart: always
        environment:
          MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: prisma
        volumes:
          - mysql:/var/lib/mysql
    volumes:
      mysql:
    ```
1. Run `docker-compose up -d`
1. Set the `endpoint` in `prisma.yml` to `http://localhost:4466`

### 5. GraphQL Server
Start graphql server -- next we will deploy the data

```bash
npm run start
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to explore the API of your GraphQL server in a [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground).


### 6. Database Setup
For this example, you'll use a free _demo database_ (AWS Aurora) hosted in Prisma Cloud.
```bash
prisma deploy
```

### 6. Using the GraphQL API

The schema that specifies the API operations of your GraphQL server is defined in [`./src/schema.graphql`](./src/schema.graphql). Below are a number of operations that you can send to the API using the GraphQL Playground.

Feel free to adjust any operation by adding or removing fields. The GraphQL Playground helps you with its auto-completion and query validation features.


### 7. Query and Mutatate Data
Lets do this :)

#### Retrieve all published posts and their authors

```graphql
query {
  feed {
    id
    title
    content
    published
    author {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```


#### Create a new user

```graphql
mutation {
  signupUser(
    name: "Sarah"
    email: "sarah@prisma.io"
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

#### Create a new draft

```graphql
mutation {
  createDraft(
    title: "Join the Prisma Slack"
    content: "https://slack.prisma.io"
    authorEmail: "alice@prisma.io"
  ) {
    id
    published
  }
}
```

#### Publish an existing draft

```graphql
mutation {
  publish(id: "__POST_ID__") {
    id
    published
  }
}
```

> **Note**: You need to replace the `__POST_ID__`-placeholder with an actual `id` from a `Post` item. You can find one e.g. using the `filterPosts`-query.

#### Search for posts with a specific title or content

```graphql
{
  filterPosts(searchString: "graphql") {
    id
    title
    content
    published 
    author {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

#### Retrieve a single post

```graphql
{
  post(id: "__POST_ID__") {
    id
    title
    content
    published
    author {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: You need to replace the `__POST_ID__`-placeholder with an actual `id` from a `Post` item. You can find one e.g. using the `filterPosts`-query.

#### Delete a post

```graphql
mutation {
  deletePost(id: "__POST_ID__") {
    id
  }
}
```

> **Note**: You need to replace the `__POST_ID__`-placeholder with an actual `id` from a `Post` item. You can find one e.g. using the `filterPosts`-query.


### 6. Changing the GraphQL schema

To make changes to the GraphQL schema, you need to manipulate the `Query` and `Mutation` types that are defined in [`index.ts`](./src/index.ts). 

Note that the [`start`](./package.json#L6) script also starts a development server that automatically updates your schema every time you save a file. This way, the auto-generated [GraphQL schema](./src/generated/schema.graphql) updates whenever you make changes in to the `Query` or `Mutation` types inside your TypeScript code.
